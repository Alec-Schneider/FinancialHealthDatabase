# Financial Health Database

## A database created to help users understand their financial postion

A semester long project for class IST659 Database Administration and Database Management, in the Applied Data Science Master's program at Syracuse University.

Aim of the project is to build a database to:
1. Create a conceptual model of the database
2. Create the logical model from the conceptual model
3. Implement the tables and relationships as a database in SQL Server
4. Create stored procedures, views, and functions for users of the database to be able to apply CRUD methods to the database
5. Connect the database through the server to a Python or R script in order to retrieve data and run any analysis.
6. Build a GUI (building a web version with Flask) to create users, create accounts, update their cash flow, accounts, and password, etc.
7. Answer all questions a user would have about their financial health such as:
 	* What is my debt to income ratio?
 	* What percent of my monthly income am I spending?
 	* How has spending changed over time?
 	* How has my debt changed over time?
 	* What is my debt to bank account balance ratio?
 	* How much interest am I paying on my debt every year?


May create a website, using Flask. **TBD**
